# news-summarizer
News summarization is the process of condensing a large news article or document into a shorter version while retaining the important information and conveying the main idea. With the advent of NLP techniques, automatic news summarization has become a popular area of research.

In this mini-project, various NLP techniques and tools for news summarization are used. You will start by collecting a corpus of news articles and preprocessing the data to clean and tokenize the text.

The challenges and limitations of news summarization, such as dealing with ambiguity, maintaining coherence, and preserving the authorâ€™s intent, can be identified and managed.
